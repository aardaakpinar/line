### What Is Line?

**The Line** is the only right way for computer **nerds**.  
  
From black hats to white hats,  
from programmers to hardware specialists,  
our goal is to bring all computer nerds  
together under The Line.  
  
We are not interested in who you are —  
**only in how hungry you are for knowledge.**  
  
Because one thing is certain:  
  
**We will never know everything.**  
And that is exactly why we keep moving forward,  
on the Line.

### Our Manifesto
```
We break.
We analyze.
We rewrite.

Because no system is perfect.
Neither are we.

That’s why we move forward,
without ever leaving The Line.
```
